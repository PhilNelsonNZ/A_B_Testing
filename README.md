# A_B_Testing
A_B_Testing Project

* This repository an A/B testing project using Python3

* Part 1. It Examines the Probability of customer conversion for two webpages - "old_page" and "new_page". It checks the data and removes erroneous data and then confirms data integrity

* Part 2. A/B Test. It examines the null hypothesis that regardless of whether the page is "old_page" or "new_page" the conversion rate will be the same.  Using sampling it simulates the conversion rate of the "old_page" and the "new_page" and examines the differences.  The z-test statistic and p-value are calculated.

* Part 3. Regression. This section uses statistical models to fit a regression model to the data. The regression considers individual factors of country and page on conversion, and it also examines the interaction between page and country to see if there are significant effects on conversion.
